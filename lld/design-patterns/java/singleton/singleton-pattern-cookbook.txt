Singleton Pattern Cookbook:

For a single threaded environment...
1. Ensure that there is a private constructor in the intended class.
2. Ensure the the intended class contains `getInstance()` and
	- if it's not meant for production, it can have a `resetInstance()` method.
3. Ensure that all the implemented methods are handled for preventing `NullPointerException`(s).

For multi-threaded environment...
1. Ensure that there is a private constructor in the intended class.
2. Ensure that the intended class contains `getInstance()` with double check locking using the `synchronized` keyword.
	- if it's not meant for production, it can have a `resetInstance()` method.
3. Ensure that all the implemented methods are handled for preventing `NullPointerException`(s)s.
