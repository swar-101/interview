Caching



Benefits of caching:

	1. Improves read speed (Note: Doesn't improve write speed)

	2. It saves us from doing expensive computes multiple times.

	3. Reduces load on DB.




Challenges:

	1. Invalidation
	2. Eviction

Memory Hierarchy:

	"Memory / Supply chains are always hierarchical"
	
	
	e.g. Grocery Store -- Distributor -- factory -- raw materials
	
	
	e.g. Human brain memory types:
	
			Types							Traits						Capacity 			  Accessibility
		1. Working memory           (fastest,    very small)           4-7 items				Random Access
		2. Short term memory 		(slow,       large)	              1000 items            	Random Access
		3. Long term memory         (very slow,  very large)             ♾️                 Sequential Access
		
		

		
	Hardware -- CPU -- Registers 0.2 ns / small / <1KB -- L1 Cache -- L2 Cache -- L3 Cache
	
	Note: If CPU as 4 cores, there are four L1 and L2 cache corresponding to each core.
			While L3 cache has shared access across all the cores.
			
			
	Hardware -- RAM (slower compared to CPU) very fast 10 ns / large upto 64 GB till 12 TB


	Hardware -- HDD (very slow) 		10 ms  (1 million times slower than RAM)
			 -- SSD (tad bit faster)     2 ms  
	
	Hardware -- External -- Tape Drive
						 -- CD ROM
